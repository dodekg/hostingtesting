							<p>As any good invention bicycle can be used in many different applications. It is a good way to commute short or medium distances and that happens in real life as mentioned before within Cycle to Work Scheme. With the development of smartphones and sat-nav it became possible to give bicycles a new application as a good way to deliver food. Now it is a huge industry that is cheap, efficient and helps save lives during the pandemic. In UK three brands emerged as the leaders in this business: Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat.</p>

							<p>“Deliveroo is the biggest name in delivery for a reason - it was one of the very first services that really took off, and certainly has the slickest experience to offer up to users.
							It's simple to get started - you just download the app to your phone, then put in some details to create an account and let it know where you're located. You'll then be able to see what sort of food you can get from your area, each with its own rating, menu and information about how far away it is, and when you can expect the food to arrive if you do order.
							The range of takeaways available is huge, and big brands like KFC and McDonald's are also on board, so you're unlikely to be short of places to choose from, especially if you're in a city.

							<p> Once you've picked, there's a small service fee and a delivery charge, although you can opt to pay £3.99 each month to waive the delivery fee over a minimum amount - the maths on that being worth it will depend on how often you order and in what quantities!
							Just Eat is another major player in the delivery space, and actually has far more options on its books than Deliveroo, having been on the scene a bit longer. The app isn't quite as slick as Deliveroo's, though, in particular lacking the ability to see where your order or delivery person actually is to get a sense of how imminent it is.
							Finally, we come to Uber Eats, a pivot from Uber that took many people by surprise when it was announced but makes sense when you think about the logistics of routing drivers around being fairly similar whether they're ferrying food or people.” (Freeman-Mills,2021)

							<p> It is worth to mention that it is not an easy profession and to make it profitable you need to cycle quickly as one delivery is on average 4 pounds. It is not easy to register as well as it takes roughly one month with all criminal checks. If you pass through a queue you will have to instal company app and buy a starter pack (Deliveroo provides free starter packs).
							Just Eat is a brand that grows quickly and exceeds its competition. The proof of that is the reliable network of Just Eat Cycles around the City of Edinburgh – another way of getting the profit in bicycle business.
