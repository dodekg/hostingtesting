							The beginnings of settlement in the Żary area 
							date back to prehistoric times. The name “Zara”,
							deriving most likely from a small, independent West
							Slavic tribe, appeared for the first time in
							1007 in the chronicles of Thietmar of
							Merseburg, at the time, when Duke
							Bolesław I Chrobry of Poland had 
							conquered the Żary land along with 
							the eastern March of Lusatia. 
							Regained by Emperor Conrad II in 1031,
							the city was chartered on the 
							Magdeburg law by the Wettin margrave
							Henry III of Meissen about 1260.
							It covered the following three areas:
							a trade settlement on the “Salt Trail” running from Leipzig
							to Wrocław, a fortified town erected
							among bogs (in the area of the later 
							castle), and a Franciscan settlement
							established in 1274.

								In a twin town (to Zary) called Zagan lived
								german scientist Jahaness Kepler who alongside with 
								polish astonomer Copernicus and italian physicist Galileo 
								Galilei built the foundations for Laws of Gravity discovered 
								later on by british mathematician Isaac Newton!
							</p>
							<p>
								Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz,
								where he became an associate of Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg.
								Later he became an assistant to the astronomer Tycho Brahe in Prague,
								and eventually the imperial mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II
								and his two successors Matthias and Ferdinand II. He also taught
								mathematics in Linz, and was an adviser to General Wallenstein.

							<p>
								 Georg Philipp Telemann (24 March 1681 – 25 June 1767)
								 was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist. 
								 Almost completely self-taught in music, he became a composer 
								 against his family's wishes. After studying in Magdeburg, 
								 Zellerfeld, and Hildesheim, Telemann entered the University 
								 of Leipzig to study law, but eventually settled on a career 
								 in music. He held important positions in Leipzig, Zary, 
								 Eisenach, and Frankfurt before settling in Hamburg in 1721, 
								 where he became musical director of that city's five main 
								 churches. Zary's music school holds his name.

					<h3>Stalag Luft III & The Great Escape</h3>
					<p>	
						In March 1942, twin town Zagan became the location of the Stalag Luft III camp for 
						captured airmen (Kriegsgefangenen Stammlager der Luftwaffe 3 Sagan).
						<img src="images/Model_Stalag_Luft_III.jpg" title="Model of Stalag Luft III thanks to Wikipedia" alt="image of camp paper model" style="float:left;">
						It was
						the site of the most courageous escape resulting in the killing of 50 prisoners
						including the following Polish flight officers: Major Antoni Kiewnarski; Lieutenant
						Stanislaw Krol; and navigation Lieutenants Włodzimierz Kolanowski, Jerzy Mondschein
						, Kazimierz Pawluk and Paweł Tobolski.
						
						This episode of history was the subject of 
						the 1963 film The Great Escape, starring Steve McQueen. It was the biggest and the
						most deadly escape of officer aircrew captured by Nazi Germany during the entire
						war. The number of prisoners attempting the escape was 200, of whom 76 managed to
						leave the camp; 73 were caught and 50 executed on Hitler's orders. Just three
						successfully escaped, one to Gibraltar and two to Sweden.[10] All three re-united
						in England.
						<img src="images/TheGreatEscape.jpg" title="The Great Escape movie poster thanks to Wikipedia" alt="image of The Great Escape" style="float:right;">
						There were only a few other, similar escapes from German POW camps in the Second
						World War. A slightly smaller one on March 6, 1943 from the oflag in Szubin,
						involving 43 British officers. On September 19–20, 1943, an escape from the
						Oflag VI B in Doessel near Wartburg involved 47 Polish officers. A day later 
						67 French officers escaped from Edelbach in Austria 67. Another involved 54
						French soldiers on December 18, 1943, from Marlag near Hamburg.
