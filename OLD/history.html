					<h2>The New Register House</h2>
					<p>
					Princes Street is a very historical spot. The street lies on the 
					line of a medieval country lane known as the Lang Dykes. Princes Street 
					was built in the late 18th century during the reign of King George the Third.
					Princes Street was part of the new section of Edinburgh and was named
					for King George’s sons after its original name was rejected.
					</p>

					</figure>
										
					<p>
					Princes Street starts off at Waterloo Place, which is situated at
					the East End and goes all the way to Shandwick Place, which is found 
					at the West End and it is about ¾ of a mile length. 
					It is also best 
					known for its exciting attractions and its many interesting and unusual 
					shops that run along its entire length.

					<h2>Scott Monument</h2>
					<p>
						Another famous landmark that you will find on Princes Street
						is the two hundred feet tall neo-gothic monument dedicated 
						to the well-known writer, Sir Walter Scott.

					</p>

					<p>
						Often you will 
						find a Scottish piper, dressed in his traditional Scottish 
						dress, and his dog near the blackened statue of Sir Walter 
						Scott playing away on his bagpipes. If you have the strength
						and the energy you can climb up the 287 steps to the top, 
						you will be rewarded with a stunning view of the Edinburgh
						skyline.

					<h2>Scottish National Gallery</h2>
					<p>
						The Scottish National Gallery (formerly the National 
						Gallery of Scotland) is the national art gallery of Scotland.
						It is located on The Mound in central Edinburgh, 
						close to Princes Street. The building was designed in
						a neoclassical style by William Henry Playfair, 
						and first opened to the public in 1859.
					</p>

						The gallery houses Scotland's national collection of fine

					<h2>Princes Street Gardens</h2>
					<p>
						During the construction of the New Town, the polluted 
						waters of the Nor Loch were drained, and the area was
						converted into private gardens called Princes Street Gardens.
						This was taken over by the Edinburgh Council in the 
						late-nineteenth century, by which time most of the street 
						was commercial and there was no great need for private 
						residential gardens. 
					</p>

					<figure>
						<img width="70%" height="300px" class="img-fluid float-right py-2" src="images/inHistory/DSC_0139.jpg" alt="There should be image here" title="Princes Street Gardens"/>
					</figure>					
					
					<p style="float-right">
						The width of Princes Street was 
						greatly increased soon after, onto what was the northern 
						edge of the gardens. Due to the much lower position of
						the gardens this led to the creation of the steep
						embankment on the north side, still visible today.
						The gardens are one of the many green spaces in 
						the heart of Edinburgh.
					</p>
					<div style="clear:both">
					</div>
					
					<p style="float-left">
						Along the path within Princes Street Gardes you can come
						accross an unusual monument of Voytek the bear. Voytek 
						(1942–1963) was a Syrian brown bear bought, as a young 
						cub, at a railway station in Hamadan, Iran, by Polish II 
						Corps soldiers who had been evacuated from the Soviet Union.
						In order to provide for his rations and transportation,
						he was eventually enlisted officially as a soldier with the 
						rank of private, and was subsequently promoted to corporal.
					</p>

					</figure>
					
					<p style="float-right">
						He accompanied the bulk of the II Corps to Italy, 
						serving with the 22nd Artillery Supply Company.
						During the Battle of Monte Cassino, in Italy in 1944,
						Voytek helped move crates of ammunition and became a
						celebrity with visiting Allied generals and statesmen.
						After the war, mustered out of the Polish Army,
						he was billeted and lived out the rest of his life at
						the Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland.
