						Near to Waverly Station you will find the Princes Mall shopping
						center and the tourist information center. The Princess Mall has 
						numerous small shops and boutiques on the two and a half floors.
						The tourist information center has a wide array of leaflets and
						brochures informing visitors of upcoming events and attractions 
						taking place in Edinburgh. You can also get assistance with 
						accommodation near to Princes Street and around the city center.

						Several UK high street brands such as Boots, Scotland's largest
						Boots city store, H&M, Debenhams, Marks & Spencer, Topman and
						Topshop, are just a few of the shops located along Princes Street. 
						Jenners department store (now owned by House of Fraser) is an 						
						Edinburgh institution, surviving the disappearance of many other 
						local department stores, such as Patrick Thompson's. The mix on
						Princes Street is now more diverse, with several "lower market" 
						chains such as Primark, Poundland and Bargain Books.

						The building's architecture is Victorian, influenced by
						the traditional Scottish baronial style. It was designed by
						architect William Hamilton Beattie and for most of the twentieth
						century was known as the North British Hotel or simply the N.B.,
						a traditional railway hotel built for the North British Railway
						Company adjacent to their newly rebuilt Waverley station. 
					</p>

				<div class="col-md-4 card2">	
					<p>
						While under railway ownership, the hotel had porters in red 
						jackets who would take passengers and their luggage directly 
						into the hotel via a lift. Ownership passed into the hands of
						the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923.

					<h2>The New St James Quarter</h2>
					<p>
						An Â£850m redevelopment of the former shopping centre, New St.
						Andrew's House office and hotel by its owners, Henderson Global Investors,
						is currently under construction. The existing 1973 building has been completely
						demolished to make way for a three-storey, glass-roofed, crescent-shaped building
						designed by Allan Murray Architects. Edinburgh City Council planners gave the plans
						approval in July 2015 despite objections from conservation groups concerned about
						the possible impact on the city's World Heritage status.

						If you are an ethusiast of shopping there are a news that may interest you.
						At the begining of year 2021, just at the foot of Princes Street there will
						be opening of a huge shopping mall with anything you want to spend a nice 
						chilling Saturday afternoon buying things.
