				<h2><a name="napster">About Napster</a></h2>

				<p class="blue">
				
				Napster is a set of three music-focused online services.
				It was founded in 1999 as a pioneering peer-to-peer (P2P)
				file sharing Internet software that emphasized sharing 
				digital audio files, typically audio songs, encoded in 
				MP3 format. As the software became popular, the company 
				ran into legal difficulties over copyright infringement. 
				It ceased operations and was eventually acquired by Roxio
				. In its second incarnation, Napster became an online 
				music store until it was acquired by Rhapsody from Best 
				Buy[1] on December 1, 2011. 
				</p>
				<p class="blue">
				Napster was founded by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker.[2] Initially,
				Napster was envisioned by Fanning as an independent peer-to-peer 
				file sharing service. The service operated between June 1999 and
				July 2001.[3] Its technology allowed people to easily share their 
				MP3 files with other participants.[4] Although the original service
				was shut down by court order, the Napster brand survived after the
				company's assets were liquidated and
				purchased by other companies through bankruptcy proceedings.[5]

					For those who don’t remember, Napster was a popular peer-to-peer file sharing network that launched in 1999.
					 It had an amazingly large fan-base of music lovers who shared mp3s.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, two years later the company was involved in a joint lawsuit filed by various record companies.
				</p>
				<p>
					They didn’t like the large-scale distribution of their music for free, and so sued the company for infringement
					on their intellectual property. This is what makes this case one of the most famous copyright infringement cases in history.
				</p>
				<p>
					The court ruled against Napster and the company was forced to shut down the site after making a public apology and paying
					 $26m in damages. It was their lack of effort to reduce infringement, mixed with the fact that the company financially
					 benefitted from it that set the decision in stone.

				<h2><a name="parker">About Sean Parker</a></h2>
				<p>
					Sean Parker (born December 3, 1979) is an American
					entrepreneur and philanthropist, most notable 
					for co-founding the file-sharing computer service
					Napster, and serving as the first president of 
					the social networking website Facebook. He also
					co-founded Plaxo, Causes, Airtime.com, and 
					Brigade, an online platform for civic engagement.
					[4][5][6][7][8][9] He is the founder
					and chairman of the Parker Foundation, which 
					focuses on life sciences, global public health, 
					and civic engagement.[10] On the Forbes 2016
					list of the world's billionaires, he was ranked
					#722 with a net worth of US$2.4 billion.[11] 
				</p>
				<p>
					Parker was born in Herndon, Virginia, to Diane Parker, a TV advertising
					broker, and Bruce Parker, a U.S. government 
					oceanographer and Chief Scientist at NOAA.
					[4][5][12][13] When Parker was seven, his 
					father taught him how to program on an Atari
					800.[4] Parker's father, who put his family 
					before his entrepreneurial dreams, told Parker
					"if you are going to take risks, take them early 
					before you have a family."[14] As a teenager, 
					Parker's hobbies were hacking and programming.[5] 
					One night, while hacking into the network of a 
					Fortune 500 company, Parker was unable to log out
					after his father confiscated his computer keyboard.
					[5] Because his IP address was exposed, F.B.I. 
					agents tracked down the 16-year-old.[5] Since
					Parker was under 18, he was sentenced to community service.[5]
