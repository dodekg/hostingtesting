						<p>
							Arthur's Seat is an extinct volcano which is the main peak
							of the group of hills in Edinburgh, Scotland, which form most of Holyrood Park.
							It is situated just to the east of the city centre, about 1 mile (1.6 km)
							to the east of Edinburgh Castle. The hill rises above the city to a height of 250.5 m (822 ft),
							provides excellent panoramic views of the city and beyond,
							is relatively easy to climb, and is popular for hillwalking.
							Though it can be climbed from almost any direction, the easiest 
							and simplest ascent is from the east, where a grassy slope rises above Dunsapie Loch.
							At a spur of the hill, Salisbury Crags has historically been a rock 
							climbing venue with routes of various degrees of difficulty, but due to hazards,
							rock climbing is now restricted to the South Quarry and a permit is required.

						<p>
							The acient remains of an old chapel gives the place magic flavour.
							The origin and the history of the chapel are obscure,
							but it was certainly built no later than the early 15th century,
							as in 1426 it is recorded that the Pope gave money for its repair.
							The chapel may have been linked to the Preceptory of St. Anthony,
							a skin hospice, which was based in Leith around this time.
							It may have been linked to the nearby Holyrood Abbey.

							St Margaret's Loch is a shallow man-made loch to the south of Queen's Drive.
							It is around 500 m east of Holyrood Palace, and about 100 m north of the ruin 
							of St Anthony's Chapel. Once a boggy marshland, the loch was formed in 1856 
							as part of Prince Albert's improvement plans for the area surrounding the palace.
							The loch has been used as a boating pond but is now home to a strong population
							of ducks, geese, and swans.

						<p>
							Also called the Queen's Park.
						</p>
						<p>
							Holyrood Park (also called the Queen's Park or King's Park 
							depending on the reigning monarch's gender) is a royal 
							park in central Edinburgh, Scotland about 1 mile 
							(1.6 kilometres) to the east of Edinburgh Castle.
							It is open to the public. It has an array of hills, 
							lochs, glens, ridges, basalt cliffs, and patches of 
							gorse, providing a wild piece of highland landscape 
							within its 650-acre (260 ha) area. The park is associated
							with the royal palace of Holyroodhouse and was formerly
							a 12th-century royal hunting estate. The park was created
							in 1541 when James V had the ground "circulit about Arthurs
							Sett, Salisborie and Duddingston craggis" enclosed by a 
							stone wall.

						<p>
						Arthur's Seat, an extinct volcano and the highest point in Edinburgh,
						is at the centre of the park, with the cliffs of Salisbury Crags to the west.
						There are three lochs; St Margaret's Loch, Dunsapie Loch, and Duddingston Loch.
						The ruined St Anthony's Chapel stands above St Margaret's Loch.
						Queen's Drive is the main route through the Park, and is partly closed on Sundays to motor vehicles.
						St Margaret's Well and St Anthony's Well are both natural springs within the park.
						Holyrood Park is located to the south-east of the Old Town, at the edge of the city centre. 
						Abbeyhill is to the north, and Duddingston village to the east.
						The University of Edinburgh's Pollock Halls of Residence are to the south-west, 
						and Dumbiedykes is to the west.
						Holyrood Park is one of Scotland's Properties in Care,
						owned by Scottish Ministers and managed on their behalf by Historic Environment Scotland.

						<p>
							It is sometimes said that its name is derived from legends pertaining 
							to King Arthur, such as the reference in Y Gododdin. Some support for
							this may be provided by several other hilltop and mountaintop features
							in Britain which bear the same or similar names, such as the peak of Ben
							Arthur (The Cobbler) in the western highlands, sometimes known as Arthur's Seat,
							and Arthur's Chair on the ridge called Stone Arthur in the English Lake District.
							There is no traditional Scottish Gaelic name for Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, 
							but William Maitland proposed that the name was a corruption of Àrd-na-Said, 
							implying the "Height of Arrows", which over the years became Arthur's Seat 
							(perhaps via "Archer's Seat"). Alternatively, John Milne's proposed etymology 
							of Àrd-thir Suidhe meaning "place on high ground" uncomfortably 
							requires the transposition of the name elements.

				<p>
					This website has been made by Lukasz Galik as a part of course assesment at the Edinburgh College.
					The choosen topic of "Arthur's Seat and Holyrood Park" was one of the available topics offered to 
					every student taking in that subject. I made my topic choice of this website driven by my fascination and charm
					of scottish nature, hills and unpredictable weather.
